# Bollinger Squeeze Advanced

Bollinger Squeeze Advanced is a custom histogram indicator for MT4 and MT5 coded by EarnForex.com. The original version of this indicator was coded by Nick Bilak for MetaTrader 4. The indicator shows the current trend's strength and direction. Unlike [Bollinger Squeeze Basic](https://github.com/EarnForex/Bollinger-Squeeze-Basic), this indicator can use one of the eight oscillators as the trend measuring indicator.

The presented version of Bollinger Squeeze Advanced provides two alert types: on change of the relationship between the Bollinger bands and Keltner channel - a signal for sideways/trending market; and on cross of the zero line by the histogram - a signal for trend direction change.
